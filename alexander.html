    <h1><i class="fa-solid fa-crown"></i> Alexander the Great</h1>
    <h3>King of Macedonia — Conqueror of the Known World (356–323 BCE)</h3>
    <p>
      Alexander III of Macedon, known as Alexander the Great, stands as one of history’s most extraordinary figures.
      Trained by Aristotle and inspired by Homeric heroism, Alexander united the Greek city-states and launched one of the most successful military campaigns ever recorded.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the age of thirty, he had conquered the mighty Persian Empire and extended his realm from Greece to Egypt, Persia, and India.
      His vision was not merely conquest, but the fusion of East and West — a world united under culture, knowledge, and ambition.
    </p>
    <blockquote>“There is nothing impossible to him who will try.”</blockquote>
    <p>
      Alexander’s legacy is not measured by territory but by influence. He spread Hellenistic culture across continents,
      blending Greek, Persian, and Egyptian traditions that would shape the ancient world for centuries.
      His name became synonymous with greatness itself.
